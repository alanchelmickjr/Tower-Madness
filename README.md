## 🎮 Elevator Operator - The Flagship Game

### Overview
**Elevator Operator** is a retro-style arcade game set in the chaotic Frontier Tower in downtown San Francisco. Built specifically for 2-player arcade cabinets, this game brings cooperative and competitive gameplay to the vertical chaos of a 16-floor tech hub.

As the elevator operator (or operators in 2-player mode!), you must navigate the social dynamics, special events, and disasters while managing an increasingly complex cast of characters and situations. Experience the gritty reality of downtown SF - dodge obstacles just to reach the building entrance, hope the doorman John is at his post, and manage an elevator full of tech workers, artists, robots, and the occasional disaster.

- Race to the singular entrance before unwanted followers slip in
- Hope doorman John is at his post (he's not always there!)

## 🎯 Game Design Philosophy

This game captures the unique culture of Frontier Tower - a vertical village where frontier technologies meet human community. The elevator becomes a metaphor for navigating between:

- **Good vs Evil** (Floor 4 vs Basement)
- **Chaos vs Harmony** (measured by your deliveries)
- **Tech vs Humanity** (robots vs people)
- **Order vs Disorder** (disasters vs normal operation)

**Xeno's special power** represents the unifying force that can resolve all conflicts - when you pick him up, all disasters end and peace returns.
