# ðŸŽ® RUN THE WEB VERSION - 3 EASY STEPS!

The black screen bug is **FIXED**! âœ…

## Step 1: Install Pygbag
```bash
pip install pygbag
```

## Step 2: Run the Game
```bash
pygbag main_web.py
```

## Step 3: Play!
- Your browser will open automatically at `http://localhost:8000`
- Wait 10-20 seconds for loading (first time only)
- When you see "Press SPACE to Start" - you're ready!
- Press **SPACE** to start playing

---

## What to Expect

1. **Loading screen** - Python is loading in your browser (be patient!)
2. **"TOWER MADNESS" title** - Main menu appears
3. **"Press SPACE to Start"** - Game is ready!
4. **Elevator gameplay** - Use W/S to move, E to open doors

## Troubleshooting

### "Still see black screen"
- Wait 20-30 seconds (Python loading takes time)
- Check browser console (F12 key) for errors
- Try refreshing the page
- Make sure you're using Chrome or Firefox (not Safari)

### "Command not found: pygbag"
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pygbag
```

### "ModuleNotFoundError: pygame"
```bash
pip install pygame
```

### Still having issues?
1. **Test desktop version first:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   If this works, web version should work too!
